# Minecraft Bedrock Edition — manual install port

Minecraft Bedrock Edition running **natively** (no emulation, no streaming)
on ARM Linux handhelds, via the
[minecraft-linux mcpelauncher](https://github.com/minecraft-linux/mcpelauncher-manifest).
The package includes a 64-bit aarch64 EGLUT/Weston path and a 32-bit armhf
SDL path based on the working R36S port.

**Tested on:**
- Anbernic RG34XX-SP (Allwinner H700, 720x480) running muOS 2601 and Knulli —
  including sound on muOS
- Anbernic RG DS (Rockchip RK3566, dual 640x480) running ROCKNIX — the game
  runs on the primary screen; both touchscreens are mapped to it during play

It should also work on other H700-family devices (RG35XX-H/Plus/SP 2024,
RG40XX, etc.) running muOS or Knulli, and other Mali-blob ROCKNIX devices —
reports welcome. The 32-bit path targets RK3326/R36S-class devices on
dArkOS/DarkOS RE, Aurknix, and ArkOS-for-clone style PortMaster setups.

**No game files are included.** You must provide your own legally obtained
Minecraft Bedrock Edition APK (`arm64-v8a` for the 64-bit path, or
`armeabi-v7a` for the R36S/armhf path).

**NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH
MOJANG OR MICROSOFT.**

## Download

- Latest release: [v1.5.1](https://github.com/DankMiimer/minecraft-bedrock-handheld-port/releases/tag/v1.5.1)
- Port zip: [minecraftbedrock-1.5.1.zip](https://github.com/DankMiimer/minecraft-bedrock-handheld-port/releases/download/v1.5.1/minecraftbedrock-1.5.1.zip)
  — one zip for every supported firmware
- SHA-256: compare against the checksum shown on the GitHub release page or
  in `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

Do not use GitHub's "Source code" archives as the install package; they are
only repository contents and do not preserve the packaged layout.

## Quick Start

1. Extract the zip **onto your SD card** — at the root of the card (or
   network share) that holds your `roms`/`ROMS` folders. Everything lands in
   the right place on muOS, Knulli, and ROCKNIX automatically.
2. Copy your own legally obtained Minecraft Bedrock APK file(s) into
   `ports/minecraftbedrock/apk/` for your device ABI.
3. Refresh your game list and launch **Minecraft Bedrock** once to extract
   the game.
4. Delete the APK file(s) from the `apk/` folder.

## Requirements

- aarch64 device on Knulli, muOS, or ROCKNIX-style PortMaster setup, or an
  armhf-capable RK3326/R36S setup with `/dev/dri`
- ~2 GB free space on the ports partition (game assets are large)
- For the 64-bit path: WiFi on first launch so the launcher can fetch its
  Weston runtime if it is missing (53 MB), or a preinstalled compatible
  `weston_pkg_0.2` runtime
- A Minecraft Bedrock APK matching the selected path: **arm64-v8a** for
  aarch64, **armeabi-v7a** for R36S/armhf. Tested on 64-bit: **1.16.221.01**
  and **1.20.x** (1.20.15 / 1.20.51 / 1.20.62). The 32-bit path should accept
  the same broad version range as the working R36S port; 1.26+ Play builds do
  **not** work on the 64-bit path (PairIP licensing).
- **Tip — UI size:** on 1.17 and newer the in-game GUI Scale is locked small
  at these resolutions (an engine limitation, no fix launcher-side).
  **1.16.221.01 has a working GUI Scale slider** (Settings → Video), so it
  gives a properly sized UI at native resolution. On tested devices,
  1.16.221.01 runs perfectly without stutters. If the small UI on modern
  versions bothers you, 1.16 is the recommended version.

## Version Notes

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1.16.221.01 arm64/arm32 | Recommended for small screens | Working GUI Scale slider; runs perfectly without stutters on tested 64-bit devices; uses its own world/profile entry. |
| 1.20.15 / 1.20.51 / 1.20.62 arm64 | Tested | Modern gameplay; UI scale is smaller on these handheld screens. |
| 1.2+ armeabi-v7a | R36S path | Supported by the 32-bit launcher path inherited from the working R36S port; modern versions keep the small locked UI. |
| 1.21+ arm64 | Untested / may work | Not a primary target yet. |
| 1.26+ Play builds | Unsupported | Newer Android licensing/runtime dependencies are not supported by this port. |

## Updating from a previous version

Your worlds, settings, and installed game versions are never inside the
release zip, so updating cannot touch them.

- **From 1.4 or newer:** launch **Minecraft Bedrock Update** from Ports (needs
  WiFi). It downloads the latest release and updates the port in place.
- **Without WiFi:** extract the new release zip over your existing install,
  overwriting when asked. Do NOT delete the `minecraftbedrock/` folder first
  (it contains your extracted game and worlds). If your old install keeps the
  `minecraftbedrock/` folder next to the `.sh` files (pre-1.5 Knulli/ROCKNIX
  layout), copy the zip's `ports/minecraftbedrock/` contents over that folder
  instead — the launch scripts prefer the folder beside them.

## Install (details)

Extract the whole zip at the root of the storage that holds your roms:

- **muOS:** the SD card root (`/mnt/mmc`). The launch entries land in
  `ROMS/Ports/` (FAT storage is case-insensitive, so the zip's `roms/ports/`
  merges into it) and the port itself in `ports/minecraftbedrock/`.
- **Knulli:** the share root — the second SD card's root, or the network
  share (`\\KNULLI\share`). The entries land in `roms/ports/`, the port in
  `ports/minecraftbedrock/`.
- **ROCKNIX:** the games partition root (what you see from a PC; on-device
  `/storage/roms`). The zip's `ports/` folder carries both the entries and
  the port; the stray `roms/` folder it also creates is harmless and can be
  deleted.

The launch scripts find the `minecraftbedrock/` folder on their own: next to
themselves first, then in the `ports/` locations above — so the classic
"everything together in your ports folder" layout also still works.

Then:

1. Copy your APK into `ports/minecraftbedrock/apk/`. A single full APK or
   Google Play split APKs (base + matching ABI split + install-pack, together)
   both work.
2. Update your game list and launch **Minecraft Bedrock** from Ports. The
   first run extracts the game — give it a few minutes.
3. Delete the APK from the `apk/` folder afterwards.

Layout inside the zip:

```text
README.md
roms/ports/
  Minecraft Bedrock.sh
  Minecraft Bedrock 1.16.sh
  Minecraft Bedrock Update.sh
ports/
  Minecraft Bedrock.sh            (same entries, for ROCKNIX-style layouts)
  Minecraft Bedrock 1.16.sh
  Minecraft Bedrock Update.sh
  minecraftbedrock/
    apk/
      PUT_APK_HERE.txt
    bin/
    bin32/
    controls/
    lib32/
    libs.aarch64/
    setup_apk.sh
    run_bedrock.sh
```

For Google Play split APKs, copy the relevant files together into
`minecraftbedrock/apk/`, for example:

```text
base.apk
split_config.arm64_v8a.apk
split_install_pack.apk
```

For the R36S/armhf path, use the corresponding `armeabi-v7a` split instead.

You can install several versions (drop each APK in `apk/` and launch once).
The main **Minecraft Bedrock** entry runs the newest installed version.

### 1.16.221.01

For the working GUI Scale slider, install 1.16.221.01 and use the separate
**Minecraft Bedrock 1.16** entry — it runs 1.16 with its own isolated world
(older clients cannot open newer worlds). On first launch, dismiss the Xbox
sign-in prompt (press **B**) to reach the menu; sign-in is not supported.
On tested devices, 1.16.221.01 runs perfectly without stutters.

Notes: 1.16 has no cross-version LAN with 1.20, and this port applies small
built-in compatibility patches so 1.16.221.01 boots (Education Mode off,
online services disabled — LAN still works).

**LAN multiplayer flow** (same as any Bedrock version): one player opens a
world and stays in it (the host); the other player, from the **main menu**,
goes to **Play → Friends tab** and the host's world appears under "LAN
Games". You can't see each other if you're both sitting in your own separate
worlds — one hosts, the other joins from the menu. Verified working on 1.16
between an RG34XX-SP and an RG DS.

## Notes and limitations

- **No Xbox Live / Marketplace sign-in.** Local worlds work. **LAN
  multiplayer works** — verified between an RG34XX-SP (Knulli) and an RG DS
  (ROCKNIX) in the same world.
- **Audio** uses the launcher's OpenAL backend, which outputs through
  PulseAudio on Knulli and ROCKNIX (pipewire-pulse). On ALSA-only systems with
  no Pulse/PipeWire server (e.g. **muOS**), the port detects the missing server
  and automatically routes OpenAL to ALSA, so sound works out of the box.
  Force a specific OpenAL output with `MCPE_ALSOFT_DRIVERS` (e.g. `alsa` or
  `pulse`). Optional: drop a host (glibc aarch64) FMOD Engine `libfmod.so.12.0`
  from fmod.com into `minecraftbedrock/fmod/` to use real FMOD instead.
  The R36S/armhf path uses the SDL audio backend and defaults to ALSA.
- **No virtual keyboard.** Set world names etc. from a PC; save data lives in
  `minecraftbedrock/profiles/default/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang/`.
- While the game runs, the CPU governor is set to `performance` and the GPU
  minimum clock is raised; both are restored on exit
  (disable with `MCPE_PERFORMANCE_MODE=0`).
- On 4-core devices a measured thread-affinity layout is applied (render and
  simulation threads get dedicated cores) — this roughly quartered stutter on
  the H700. Recommended in-game settings for H700: render distance 3-4
  chunks, 30-40 FPS cap.
- EmulationStation is fully stopped during play and restarted afterwards
  on Knulli. On muOS, the frontend/mux launcher is stopped while Weston owns
  the framebuffer and restarted on exit.

## Controls

Default Bedrock gamepad layout (left stick move, right stick camera,
R1/RT break, L1/LT place, A jump, Start pause). Controller mappings are
matched by controller GUID from `minecraftbedrock/controls/` — hand-tuned:
RG34XX-SP (whose line also covers other Anbernic H700-family pads, they
share the same GUID), RG DS. **Unknown controllers get an auto-generated
standard-layout mapping** at launch (logged in `log.txt`) — if buttons feel
wrong on your device, see `controls/README.md` to tune the line, and please
share it!

On the R36S/armhf path, the SDL client also honours PortMaster's
`get_controls` mapping line, matching the original working R36S port behavior.

On dual-screen devices the touchscreen(s) are remapped to the game's display
while the port runs (sway `map_to_output`, the same approach ROCKNIX uses
for DraStic). If ES touch behaves oddly after quitting, restart ES or reboot.

## Troubleshooting

Logs live at `minecraftbedrock/log.txt` and
`minecraftbedrock/weston_launch.log`.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No Minecraft version installed | No APK was copied, or extraction failed before creating `versions/` | Copy your legally obtained APK(s) into `minecraftbedrock/apk/` and launch again. |
| 32-bit path unavailable | Device lacks `/dev/dri` or an armhf loader | Use an arm64 APK on aarch64 devices, or install/test on an R36S/RK3326 firmware with armhf multilib. |
| 64-bit path unavailable | Device lacks aarch64 userspace/loader | Use an `armeabi-v7a` APK on the R36S/armhf path. |
| `Unable to locate asset: bootstrap.json` | APK assets were flattened or split files are incomplete | Re-run setup with the original APK/split files together; do not rearrange `assets/assets/`. |
| Black screen after crash | Display/session cleanup did not finish | On Knulli, restart EmulationStation with `/etc/init.d/S31emulationstation start`; on muOS, relaunch the frontend or reboot. |
| Buttons are wrong | Controller GUID is not mapped yet | Open an issue with device, firmware, and the generated mapping/log lines. |
| Tiny UI in newer versions | 1.17+ locks GUI scale on these screens | Use 1.16.221.01 for the best UI. |

## Verify the Download

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\minecraftbedrock-1.5.1.zip
```

Linux/macOS:

```sh
sha256sum minecraftbedrock-1.5.1.zip
```

Compare the result with the SHA-256 value published on the GitHub release
page (`SHA256SUMS.txt`). The README inside the zip does not hardcode the
final zip hash because that would change the archive being verified.

## Reporting Issues

Please use the issue templates. Include your device, firmware, Minecraft APK
version, and the relevant log text.

Do **not** upload APKs, extracted `versions/`, `profiles/`, worlds, or any
Mojang/Microsoft game files. Reports that require those files cannot be
handled publicly.
